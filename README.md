## A simple reaction role bot for DiscordJS V13 !

### You juste need to replace informations on the config.json and data.json files.

To get any emoji you need to post a message on Discord with the emoji you want and "\" before it ! 
Like "\:white_check_mark:" and then copy it to the data.json file.
